HR-Salary-Prediction-Dashboard

A machine learning project to predict employee salaries and build an HR dashboard.
 HR Salary Dashboard - Predictive Analytics Model

 Project Overview:
This project was developed as part of my internship at TCS iON during my BCA specialisation in Data Analytics.  
The goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that predicts employee salaries based on HR-related features and to create an interactive HR dashboard for salary insights.

  Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Removed unnecessary columns & handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding

2. Model Training:  
   - Used Random Forest Regressor for salary prediction  
   - Achieved an RÂ² Score of 0.5033 and MSE ~562M  

3. Prediction & Insights
   - Predicted salaries for new employees  
   - Conducted Feature Importance Analysis to identify key factors affecting salaries  

4. Visualisation
   - Created an HR Salary Dashboard in Excel for better decision-making  
   - Plotted feature importance using Python visualisation libraries  

Tools & Technologies:
- Python(Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Google Colab
- Microsoft Excel

 Outcomes:
- Built a machine learning model to predict employee salaries with reasonable accuracy  
- Identified important HR factors influencing salary decisions  
- Developed a dashboard to help HR with salary planning and insights 

Future Enhancements:
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  
- Exploring advanced regression models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, etc.)  
- Integrating into a live HR analytics dashboard for real-time predictions
